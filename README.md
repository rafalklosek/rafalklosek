# Welcome to My GitHub!

Hi there! 👋 I'm Rafal.

### 🧑‍💻 About Me

In my **day job**, I’m a **young tech policy wonk**, passionate about advancing **cybersecurity outcomes** through policy solutions. I have experience working across **NGOs**, the **public sector**, and the **private sector**, where I’ve had the privilege of contributing to:

- **Policy advocacy** to drive better security practices
- **Regulation improvement** to foster collaboration and innovation
- **Empowering stakeholders**—from developers to customers—to navigate the dynamic regulatory landscape with confidence

Before working on cyber policy, you could have found me having fun on GitHub. 🎉 I’ve created a couple of projects, while learning **data science** and **artificial intelligence** techniques. Programming has been great fun and learning experience, but ultimately I did not pursue it proffessionally! 

During my brief time exploring the **developer space**, I gained valuable experience in coding and learned the importance of **community building** to drive impactful technologies. 

Check out the cool project I contributed to "News cycle aggregator" - it's pinned below.🧑‍💻

My goal is to ensure that as technology continues to advance, we can all work together to create products and policies that are secure, innovative, and beneficial for everyone.
